# EchoServer Application

This is a simple EchoServer application built in Java that echoes back whatever message it receives from a client. It's a basic demonstration of socket programming where the server listens for incoming connections on a specified port and echos back whatever it receives.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Running the Application
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/EchoServer.git

### Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository:
cd EchoServer

Compile the Java files:
javac EchoServer.java

Run the EchoServer:
java EchoServer

Now, the server will echo whatever the client sends.
